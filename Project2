# Real-Time Air Pollution Monitoring using Arduino UNO
A low-cost, Arduino-based system that detects air pollution levels in real time using multiple gas sensors and displays data on an LCD screen.

# Tech Stack & Components
-  Arduino Uno
-  LCD Display (16x2)
-  Sensors:
  - MQ-135 (air quality)
  - MQ-3 (alcohol)
  - MQ-4 (methane/CH4)
  - MQ-7 (carbon monoxide)
-  Breadboard, jumpers, resistors, USB power

# Objective
To build a **portable pollution monitor** that:
- Measures air quality with 4 different sensors
- Displays real-time readings on an LCD
- Can be used for indoor, outdoor, or vehicle air analysis
  
# Features
- Real-time detection of:
  - CO, CHâ‚„, alcohol, and air contaminants
- Displays ppm values for each gas
- Threshold-based color-coded alerts (if implemented)
- Low-cost, beginner-friendly circuit
- Expandable with GSM or Wi-Fi module (future scope)
